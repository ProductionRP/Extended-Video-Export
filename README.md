Hello, **before you start to clarify that I am not the author of this mod**. I just share the update I made.
This mod will be updated as soon as a new gamebuild is released.
This version is available from *GameBuild* **1604** to **3258**.

## How to:

1. Download & install [Voukoder](https://github.com/Vouk/voukoder/releases)

2. Download & install [C++ Runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

3. Download [Extended Video Export](https://github.com/Z3do/Extended-Video-Export/releases)

4. Locate your `FiveM Application Data` folder

5. Create a `plugins` folder inside the `FiveM Application Data` folder, if you havenâ€™t got one already.

6. Extract the `ExtendedVideoExport.asi` file in to the `plugins` folder

7. Extract the `EVE` folder to `FiveM Application Data\cache\subprocess`

8. Open `ExtendedVideoExport.ini` search for **output_folder** and after it **=** put the folder path where you want your video to be exported once the export is finished. Example: `output_folder = C:\gtavvideo`
